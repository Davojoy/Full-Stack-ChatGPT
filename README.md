# 🚀 Full-Stack Backend Journey with Next.js

Welcome to my full-stack backend learning repo!

I'm learning to build robust backend systems using **Next.js**. I know most of the syntax in JavaScript as a beginner and I'm now diving deep into the full-stack backend world — not just to write code, but to understand how everything wires together from the local editor to production deployment.

This journey is structured concept-by-concept, each taught through **tiny, functional, focused projects** that make each topic real and practical.

## 🧠 How This Works

I’ve partnered with an AI that’s acting as a 20-year full-stack expert and educator (with zero patience for bloated tutorials). Here's how we’re rolling:

1. **Pick a Concept**: Each project focuses on just **one key backend concept**.
2. **Build Small**: We build a **tiny but complete** working project that demonstrates only that concept.
3. **Learn Deeply**: We wire it all up, from config to code to running app. It’s simple, but it works — and I learn everything involved.
4. **Progress Naturally**: Concepts build on each other over time, so I grow from syntax to systems-level thinking.

## 🧭 What's Next?

Pick a number or a topic that interests you from the checklist above.

For example:

> “Teach me #4 – Data Fetching Patterns.”

And we’ll jump into a small project that focuses only on that — fully functional, beginner-friendly, and laser-focused on the concept.

Let’s build the backend muscle, one small repo at a time. 💪
